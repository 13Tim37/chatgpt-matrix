Matrix Code Animation

This is a simple JavaScript animation that displays the Matrix code effect, with lines of seemingly random letters, numbers, and symbols falling vertically down a black background. The characters are in a small font size and tightly spaced together, giving the appearance of a dense stream of information. The characters move down the screen in a fluid, wave-like motion, creating the impression of a constantly flowing and evolving data stream.
